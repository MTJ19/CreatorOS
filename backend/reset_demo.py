"""
Wipes every demo/test row and Auth user from the Supabase project, so
seed_demo.py can build fresh demo data on a clean slate.

Preserves exactly one thing: the real personal account a human made while
poking at the app by hand (bhuvanmalhotra555@gmail.com / creator "Bhuvan") —
everything else in this project is demo or automated-test debris. If you add
another real account later, add its email to PRESERVE_EMAILS below first.

Run from backend/, with the venv active and real Supabase credentials in .env:

    python reset_demo.py
